# Nix Maintenance Operations (Personal use)
This is a script I use with a systemd timer and a systemd service to automate Nix maintenance operations on my personal machine.

This script is meant for Linux.
Tested on Linux Mint only.

## Run the script
Open up your terminal, cd into the directory where you downloaded the script and execute this command:
`./nix_maintenance_operations.sh`
